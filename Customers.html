                <h3>MEDICAL COVERAGE</h3>
                <p>Onboard our orbiting laboratory, where the effects of gravity are removed, this unique environment
                    makes it possible to manufacture materials of much higher quality and performance otherwise
                    unattainable in the gravity-induced conditions on Earth. Several exciting opportunities for
                    materials innovation in the microgravity environment have been identified including metallic
                    materials, nanomaterials, advanced ceramics, novel polymers and fibers, and functional coatings and
                    thin film systems.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="benefit">
                <h3>Earth Science</h3>
                <p>Our commercial space station in low-Earth orbit provides companies, researchers, and technologists
                    with a highly capable platform to study a diverse array of Earth science applications. This unique
                    vantage point offers entrepreneurs, government agencies, and academics the opportunity to explore
                    opportunities to improve disaster response and advance studies of agriculture, water quality,
                    natural resources, the atmosphere, maritime tracking, land use, and much more.</p>

            <div class="benefit">
                <h3>Biopharma</h3>
                <p>Microgravity biomanufacturing has the potential to produce products that are crucial to life on
                    Earth, like life-saving drugs. Our orbiting laboratory combines biotech with space-tech to provide
                    the ultimate testbed and production facility for drug discovery and development, tissue engineering,
                    bioprinting, and an array of other regenerative medicine applications.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="benefit">
                <h3>Human Research</h3>
                <p>Human research studies which observe how humans adapt and respond to spaceflight will lead to a
                    better understanding of human health in microgravity. The results from these studies will be
                    increasingly important as we transition from hundreds of humans working and living in space to
                    thousands. There are also many terrestrial applications that will be leveraged from these studies,
                    like accelerated aging and impacts to vision, which will be used to improve pharmaceutical
                    therapeutics.</p>

                <h3>Manufacturing</h3>
                <p>Space offers the potential to leverage unique research and manufacturing environments with applications to a broad range of sectors. Features including microgravity, vacuum, and increased levels of radiation can enable new processes or reveal new insights.

                <h3>Media/Marketing</h3>
                <p>Space is a highly engaging, inspiring, and motivating environment that impacts a global audience. Our commercial space station in low-Earth orbit can provide extremely unique and valuable opportunities to produce new content that will support every sector of media and entertainment.
