                        <h3>Nuclear Fission: Massive Energy, Endless Supply</h3>
                        <span>The heat energy in the nuclear power plant can be generated through a nuclear reaction or
                            nuclear fission. The heavy elements of nuclear fission are Uranium/Thorium is carried out
                            within
                            a special device called a nuclear reactor. A huge amount of energy can be generated because
                            of
                            nuclear fission. The rest parts within the nuclear, as well as conventional thermal plants,
                            are
                            the same.</span>

                        <h3>Neutron Strikes & Atom Splits</h3>
                        <span>Nuclear fission occurs when a neutron slams into a larger atom, forcing it to excite and
                            split
                            into two smaller atoms—also known as fission products. Additional neutrons are also released
                            that can initiate a chain reaction. When each atom splits, a tremendous amount of energy is
                            released.This energy can be harnessed for electricity generation in nuclear power plants.
                            The
                            controlled chain reaction within a reactor is crucial for maintaining safety and
                            efficiency.</span>

                        <h3>Nuclear Reactors Powering Safe, Clean Energy</h3>
                        <span>Nuclear reactors are the heart of a nuclear power plant. They contain and control nuclear
                            chain reactions that produce heat through a physical process called fission. That heat is
                            used
                            to make steam that spins a turbine to create electricity. The steam is then cooled and
                            condensed
                            back into water for reuse in the system.This process provides a reliable and low-carbon
                            energy
                            source for
                            millions of people worldwide.</span>

                        <span>The Space Station is a large spacecraft in orbit around Earth. It serves as a home where
                            crews
                            of astronauts and cosmonauts live. The space station is also a unique science laboratory.
                            Several nations work together to build and use the space station. It provides valuable
                            insights
